# Data Science & Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science and Analytics Portfolio.
This repository contains a curated collection of personal and technical projects demonstrating my skills in:
1. Data cleaning & preparation
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Machine learning (supervised & deep learning)
4. Data visualisation
5. Statistical reasoning
6. Reporting & insight generation

Each project is stored in its own folder with a dedicated README explaining the purpose, tools used, analysis steps, and key findings.

## About This Repository

This portfolio has been created to showcase my practical experience working with:
1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow)
2. Excel (PivotTables, dashboards, cleaning)
3. Jupyter Notebooks
4. Machine learning workflows
5. EDA and insight communication

The projects highlight my ability to work with real-world datasets, draw meaningful conclusions, and present results clearly.

## Project Structure

Each project folder includes:
1. A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with full analysis or modelling steps
2. A README.md describing the project
3. Supporting files or datasets (where applicable)

**Current projects include:**
1. World Happiness Data Analysis (Python)
Exploratory data analysis of global happiness factors, correlation insights, and country comparisons.
2. Additional Machine Learning & Analytics Projects
More projects will be added and organised as I expand the portfolio, including:
ML classification models, ML regression models, Image classification (CNN), Excel analysis projects and Power BI dashboards (planned)

I will continue to add more projects as I grow my skills, Improve documentation and visuals to include Power BI dashboards, add PDFs or reports summarising key insights and organise datasets for reproducibility
