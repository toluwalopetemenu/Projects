**World Happiness Data Analysis with Python**

A data analysis project exploring the socio-economic factors that contribute to global happiness scores, based on the World Happiness Report dataset. Using Python for data cleaning, exploration, and correlation analysis, this project highlights the variables most strongly associated with national well-being.

**Project Overview**

This project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand:
1. What factors contribute most to a country's happiness score
2. How the happiest and least happy countries compare
3. How socio-economic indicators relate to happiness rankings

The notebook walks through the full analysis process using Python, including data import, cleaning, correlation evaluation, and country ranking.

**Tools and Libraries:** Python, Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib

Dataset: Kaggle- Available online

**Project Steps:**
1. Load data for inspection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Ranking countries to identify the top 10 happiest and 10 least happy countries
4. Visualisation

**Insights**
1. Countries with higher GDP per capita and social support tend to have significantly higher happiness scores.
2. The happiest countries share common traits such as strong institutions, economic stability, and social infrastructure.
3. Lower-ranking countries often struggle with poverty, instability, or corruption; variables that negatively correlate with happiness.
4. Correlation analysis highlights which socio-economic indicators may contribute most to national well-being.
